ADVANCED ADULT COUPLES GAME UNIVERSE (WITH CRAZYGAMES REMIX)
(Guaranteed AAA Quality • Zero Memory Leaks • Zero Functional Failures • Fully Real-Time • Ultra-Modern)

You are Replit’s senior full-stack architect, game engine designer, graphics/motion director, and QA lead.
Your job now is to upgrade the entire VelvetPlay Online project to a AAA-quality, fully-stable, multi-game adult play universe.

NO EXCUSES. EVERYTHING MUST WORK 100%.
No bugs. No broken flows. No half-implemented logic. No missing screens.
No memory leaks, no stale subscriptions, no runaway effects, no infinite re-renders.
Every game must run flawlessly across Desktop + Mobile with realtime sync.

Maintain PG-17 standards: flirty, spicy, bold, teasing—but strictly non-explicit, no nudity, no minors, no illegal content.

1️⃣ PHASE 1 — FIX THE ENTIRE EXISTING SYSTEM (STABILITY + FLOW)

Before adding anything new:

You MUST:

Run the project

Identify ALL runtime errors, console errors, TypeScript errors, build errors

Fix every single one

Fix all flow bugs in:

Age gate

Home screen

Game selection

Local game setup

Online room creation

Room join

Lobby ready-state sync

Real-time gameplay

Tools (dice, bottle, coin)

Summary screens

Admin panel

Fix race conditions in WebSockets

Fix broken state restorations

Fix navigation inconsistencies

Fix unmounted component memory leaks

Fix duplicate listeners

Add cleanup logic for:

WebSocket events

Timers

Interval loops

Animations

All main flows MUST function smoothly and consistently.

Once this is done: proceed.

2️⃣ PHASE 2 — ADD MORE ADULT COUPLES GAMES (PG-17)

Add these new original games:

🔹 Deep Sync

Emotional + spicy question game with escalating intensity.

🔹 Temptation Trails

Adult-couple-friendly but PG-17 safe

Animations

Smooth token movement

Dice synced with HeatDice component

Ludo board appears with cinematic transition

Pulsing tile highlights

Real-Time Sync

Must be authoritative-server model:

Backend ALWAYS decides:

Frontend sends only intent

Zero desync allowed.

4️⃣ PHASE 4 — NEW GAMES: COUPLES REMIX OF CRAZYGAMES TITLES
