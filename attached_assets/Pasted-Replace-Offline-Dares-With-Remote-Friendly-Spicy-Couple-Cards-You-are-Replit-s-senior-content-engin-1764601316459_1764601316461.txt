Replace Offline Dares With Remote-Friendly Spicy Couple Cards

You are Replit’s senior content engineer working in this repo (Velvetapp / Midnight Bond style card games).

Right now, some cards are clearly offline-only, e.g.:

“Give a shoulder massage to the person next to you.”

These do not work for remote couples and break the experience.

Your job is to:

Find and flag all offline-only prompts.

Add a large set of new, unique, remote-friendly spicy/kinky/steamy/flirty prompts for couples.

Update the game logic so remote mode only uses remote-compatible prompts.

1️⃣ Content Rules (Very Important)

For all new and modified prompts:

Audience: 18+ couples only

Tone allowed:

Flirty, seductive, daring

Spicy, wild, kinky-tease, steamy

Romantic, emotional, playful

Tone NOT allowed:

Explicit sexual acts or graphic anatomy

Pornographic detail

Non-consensual behavior

Violence or humiliation

Anything involving minors or illegal acts

Prompts must be remote-doable for couples on:

Video call

Voice call

Chat / DMs

In-app room

So no “touch the person next to you”, “kiss their neck”, “swap clothes”, etc.

Focus on things like:

Verbal teasing

Descriptions, fantasies (non-graphic)

Emotional confessions

Challenges that use camera, voice, emojis, objects they have at home

Role-play setups, dares, choices, storytelling, etc.

2️⃣ Data Model & Flags

Wherever prompts are stored (JSON/TS/DB), ensure they have at least:

{
  id: string;
  text: string;
  type: "truth" | "dare" | "challenge" | "question" | "fantasy-tease";
  spiceLevel: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
  isCoupleOnly: boolean;
  safeForRemote: boolean;  // <— enforce this
  tags: string[];          // e.g. ["remote","flirty","kinky-tease","video-call"]
}


Tasks:

Add or normalize the safeForRemote field on all prompts:

safeForRemote = false for any that clearly require in-person physical contact or proximity.

safeForRemote = true for prompts that can be done over video/voice/chat.

Add tags like:

"remote", "video-call", "voice-call", "chat-only" where appropriate.

3️⃣ Scan & Fix Existing Prompts

Search all prompt files/content modules in the repo (e.g. content/packs/, data/prompts, etc.).

Identify prompts that:

Require touching someone physically

Reference “in this room” or “next to you”

Clearly assume everyone is physically together

For each such prompt:

Either:

Mark safeForRemote: false (for offline/local mode only), and

Add a remote-friendly variant with a similar flavor but doable online
(e.g. shoulder massage → guided tension-relief talk, compliment storm, camera pose challenge, etc.)

Or replace the text entirely if the card is low-quality.

Do not leave any offline-only prompts without safeForRemote: false clearly set.

4️⃣ Create New Remote-Only Spicy Couple Packs

Create at least 3 new packs of remote-first prompts:

Remote Heatwave (Spice 3–4)

Video/voice teasing, body-language games, remote dares.

Couples only, all safeForRemote: true.

Signal & Tease (Spice 4–5)

Kinky-tease cards using:

code words

emojis

reactions

short role-play scenarios

Strongly spicy but still PG-17 (no explicit acts).

Distance Desire (Spice 2–3)

Emotional + sensual prompts focused on:

longing, anticipation, reminiscing past moments, planning future dates

Great for long-distance couples winding up the connection without being explicit.

Each pack should have 40–60 unique prompts:

No repeats

No formulaic “copy/paste with one word changed”

Mix of:

truths

dares

challenges

fantasy-tease cards

questions

Mark them all:

isCoupleOnly: true
safeForRemote: true
tags: include "remote"

5️⃣ Wire safeForRemote into Game Logic

Find the code responsible for selecting prompts for a game session (e.g. promptEngine, getNextPrompt, or equivalent).

Update it so:

When game mode is remote / online-couple:

Filter prompts with safeForRemote === true only.

Prefer packs / tags with "remote".

When game mode is local / in-person:

You may include both remote and non-remote prompts, OR

Optionally give a preference to safeForRemote === false for more physical dares.

Make sure:

The remote mode never shows cards like “give a shoulder massage to the person next to you”.

Selection logic respects spice level and couple preferences like before.

6️⃣ Validation & Testing

Before finishing, Replit must:

Run the app and start a remote couple game:

Ensure only remote-doable cards appear in several rounds.

Confirm no “touch the person next to you” type cards.

Start a local/offline party game:

Confirm physical dares still exist if allowed for that mode.

Check:

TypeScript / build passes

No runtime errors in console when drawing new prompts

All new prompts conform to the schema, no missing keys.

Finally, in the response, list:

Files changed (prompt data and selection logic).

Packs added and approximate number of new remote-friendly prompts.
