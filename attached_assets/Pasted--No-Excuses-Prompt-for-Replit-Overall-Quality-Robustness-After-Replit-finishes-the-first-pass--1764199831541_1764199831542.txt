“No Excuses” Prompt for Replit (Overall Quality & Robustness)

After Replit finishes the first pass, paste this into the chat with the agent:

The first version is NOT enough. Now do a full quality + robustness pass over this entire repo and upgrade it to AAA production grade:

Zero runtime errors & zero TypeScript errors

Run npm run build (or the equivalent) for frontend and backend.

Fix all TS, lint, and runtime issues.

Ensure the dev server starts cleanly with no red errors in console.

Architecture sanity

Verify /frontend, /backend, and /shared are properly separated.

Ensure shared types are actually imported/used instead of duplicated.

Remove dead code, unused imports, and any leftover placeholder files.

Production readiness

Frontend: add error boundaries, loading states, and fallback UI for network failures and disconnected sockets.

Backend: validate ALL incoming data with schemas (Zod/class-validator) and return meaningful error responses.

Make sure JWT + guest auth flows are correct, secure, and documented in README.

Testing & commands

Add at least a few real tests for:

prompt selection logic

room state transitions

heat level updates

Ensure npm test (or pnpm test/yarn test) actually runs and passes.

Docs

Update README.md so a competent engineer can clone, configure .env, run migrations, and start both frontend and backend without guessing.

When you’re done, summarize:

exact commands to run backend & frontend

where the main entrypoints are

any remaining limitations.

This forces it into “engineer doing a pass” mode, instead of “demo generator mode”.

2️⃣ Visual & Motion Upgrade Prompt (Make it Look Expensive)

Once it works, now you ask it to specifically upgrade the UI/animations. Paste this:

Now focus ONLY on UI/UX, graphics, and motion. The current visuals must be upgraded to look like a modern, premium, neon-velvet AAA product, NOT a basic Tailwind starter:

Goals:

No generic “card-with-border” look.

No plain flat backgrounds.

All key screens must feel cinematic, layered, and alive.

Apply these changes:

Global theming

Create a dedicated theme file or Tailwind config extension with:

multiple velvet/neon gradients

reusable shadow presets (shadow-velvet, shadow-ember, etc.)

text glow utilities

Replace all default bg-slate-*, text-gray-* style classes with custom theme classes.

Home screen

Game cards:

Add 3D tilt on hover (using Framer Motion whileHover + rotateX/Y).

Add inner glow and light sweep animation across the card face.

Use layered gradients and subtle noise texture (via CSS background image) to avoid flat color blocks.

Prompt card

Implement a real card flip animation with spring physics for next/previous prompt.

Add a soft ambient glow behind the card that changes intensity based on the prompt’s intensity level.

Use a blurred colored halo behind the card to suggest “heat”.

Heat meter

Replace any boring progress bar with:

a rounded, neon tube

an animated “liquid” fill using gradients + animated background position

a pulsing outline when heat increases

Add a small text label that changes copy based on heat range (e.g., “Warm”, “Blushing”, “Danger Zone”).

Tools (dice, bottle, coin)

Implement custom SVG or div-based shapes with:

3D-ish shading (gradients and highlights)

motion:

dice: multi-axis rotation with easing

bottle: rotation with deceleration curve

coin: flip + perspective

Ensure each animation runs via Framer Motion or requestAnimationFrame and feels smooth, not choppy.

Page transitions

Wrap routed pages in shared transition components so navigation between Home → Lobby → Game feels like a continuous, cinematic experience (fade + slide + slight blur).

Polish

Remove any visual elements that look like a generic admin dashboard.

Add consistent spacing, alignment, and responsive behavior.

Make sure mobile views are tested and visually pleasing, not squashed.

Finally, show me the key updated files and explain major UI/motion changes.

This should force it to go over the front-end and actually upgrade the look & feel.

3️⃣ Your Manual QA Checklist (How to Know It’s Actually “AAA Enough”)

In Replit:

Run everything:

Backend: npm run dev (or whatever it set up)

Frontend: npm run dev

Hit the app, open DevTools → Console must be clean (no red errors during navigation / gameplay).

Try flows like a tester:

Age gate → Home → Game detail → Local setup → Play → Summary

Age gate → Home → Online setup → Lobby → Open second browser → Join via code → Ready both → Play sync → Summary

Tools: open all (dice, bottle, coin) and try them several times.

Design sanity:

Does anything look like “default white card with border”? → Tell the agent: “This screen still looks generic. Upgrade visuals to match the velvet/neon brand.”

Does anything animate in a jumpy/laggy way? → Tell the agent to smooth that specific interaction.

Code health:

If there’s a package.json in frontend/backend: run npm run build in both. If it fails, paste the error back to the agent and say:
“Fix this build error and re-run the build until it passes.”

Responsiveness:

Resize in browser to narrow mobile width.

Check that: header, main content, and CTA buttons don’t overlap or vanish.

4️⃣ Short “Enforce No Basic Look” Prompt (for specific screens)

If any specific screen still feels basic (e.g., Lobby), paste:

The [Lobby / Gameplay / Tools / etc.] screen still looks too basic and generic.
Redesign JUST this screen to feel like a modern, premium, neon-velvet AAA interface:

Use a layered gradient background.

Add subtle animated particles.

Use custom card shapes and shadows.

Integrate Framer Motion for entry transitions and micro-interactions.

Remove any plain gray boxes or standard Tailwind demo-like layouts.
Show me the new JSX/TSX for this screen.
