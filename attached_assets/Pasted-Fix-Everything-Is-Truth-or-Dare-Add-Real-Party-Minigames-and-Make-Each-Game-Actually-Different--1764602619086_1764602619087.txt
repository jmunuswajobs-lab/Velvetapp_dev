Fix “Everything Is Truth or Dare”, Add Real Party Minigames, and Make Each Game Actually Different

You are Replit’s principal full-stack game engineer working in this repo:

https://github.com/jmunuswajobs-lab/Velvetapp_dev

Current problem:

The game catalog shows many different games

But most of them still run on the same Truth/Dare style card engine

Even arcade names like Neon Drift—Couple Mode or Emotion Ping-Pong just show dare cards

The experience is too same-y, mostly romance/kinky, not enough crazy party / drunk / wild / friends vibe.

🎯 Your mission

Stop using the same prompt engine for everything.

Keep a small set of card/prompt games.

Turn the rest into real minigames (Plato / GamePigeon style) that are actually skill/interaction-based, not dare cards.

Add new party-oriented games (friends + couples, fun/wasted/wild) and remove or hide any “fake” games that don’t have real gameplay.

Ensure every game in the catalog is actually realtime playable and clearly different.

You are allowed to delete/merge games that are just clones, as long as the final lineup is tight, fun, and stable.

1️⃣ Re-classify Games by ENGINE (not theme)

Introduce a required field on the Game model (backend + frontend):

type GameEngineType =
  | "prompt-party"    // Truth or Dare / NHIE / Hot Seat / Would You Rather
  | "prompt-couple"   // Deep Sync / Temptation Trails / etc (optional subset)
  | "board-ludo"
  | "memory-match"
  | "pong"
  | "racer"
  | "tap-duel"
  | "guessing"
  | "rhythm"
  | "roulette"
  | "tool-randomizer"; // Spin the Bottle, etc.


For each entry returned by GET /api/games:

Assign a single correct engineType.

Example:

Truth or Dare → prompt-party

Never Have I Ever → prompt-party

Hot Seat → prompt-party

Couples Challenge, Deep Sync, Temptation Trails, Dare or Devotion → prompt-couple

Velvet Ludo → board-ludo

Velvet Memory Flip → memory-match

Emotion Ping-Pong → pong

Neon Drift—Couple Mode → racer

Couples Duel Arena → tap-duel

Neon Guessing Game → guessing

Duo Rhythm Sync → rhythm

Spin the Bottle / Velvet Roulette → roulette or tool-randomizer

Expose engineType in all game APIs and client types.

2️⃣ Prune & Merge Prompt Games

There are too many “slightly renamed Truth or Dare” games.

Keep only ~4 core prompt-based games, e.g.:

Truth or Dare (party)

Never Have I Ever (party)

Would You Rather (party)

ONE couples intimacy game (e.g. Deep Sync or Couples Challenge)

For the rest of the “card” games that are basically prompts (Temptation Trails, Dare or Devotion, Heat Check, etc.):

Either:

Merge their prompts into packs / modes of the above core games, OR

Hide them from the catalog until there is a genuinely different rule set.

Do not leave 10 different tiles that all open the same “truth/dare/confession/vote” UI.

Make sure card games are clearly tagged for:

audience: "friends" | "couple" | "both"

vibe: "party" | "romantic" | "intense" | "wild"

3️⃣ Make Arcade / Board / Puzzle Games REAL Minigames (No Dares Inside)

The following games must stop using dare cards as the core gameplay:

Velvet Ludo

Velvet Memory Flip

Emotion Ping-Pong

Neon Drift—Couple Mode

Couples Duel Arena

Neon Guessing Game

Duo Rhythm Sync

Truth Bomb Run

For each of these:

Engine first, dares optional:

The primary loop is interactive: moving pieces, matching cards, hitting a ball, tapping, racing, etc.

Dares/prompts are optional consequences, shown at specific triggers (e.g., loser chooses a card, landing on special tile, etc.), not the default screen every turn.

Implement simple but real gameplay, inspired by Plato / party minigames:

Velvet Ludo (board-ludo)

Proper Ludo board, dice rolls, moves, captures, win.

Optional: landing on certain tiles triggers a party prompt (not every move).

Velvet Memory Flip (memory-match)

Real memory match grid.

On match: fun “sweet or spicy” choice, but core is matching.

Emotion Ping-Pong (pong)

Actual pong: paddles + ball + scoring to N points.

Winner can trigger a category of prompt or drinking consequence, but not every rally.

Neon Drift—Couple Mode (racer)

Simple 1v1 lane or track racer: avoid obstacles, collect boosts.

Optionally: loser draws from a dare pool, but again, gameplay is driving.

Couples Duel Arena (tap-duel)

Real-time tap/charge/defend combat with HP or score, quick rounds.

“Consequence card” only at end of round if desired.

Neon Guessing Game (guessing)

Party / couples guessing: one player answers secretly, others guess.

Could be like “Who did this?” or “What would X choose?” type game.

Duo Rhythm Sync (rhythm)

Tap in time with beat or visual prompts.

Score streaks; higher score wins.

Truth Bomb Run (runner) (you can define engineType if you like)

Simple endless runner/obstacle course; gates reveal truth categories.

Prompt is shown only when hitting gates, not as the whole game.

If any of those cannot be implemented fully right now, remove them from the catalog until they have at least a minimal but functional engine. No fake tiles.

4️⃣ Add New Party / Drunk / Wild Minigames (Friends + Couples)

Add 2–4 new minigames inspired by Plato / GamePigeon that are clearly party / wasted / wild:

Examples (you decide exact design, but they MUST be skill-based, not pure prompt lists):

Shot Roulette (tool-randomizer / roulette)

Spin wheel with segments: “you sip”, “they sip”, “group vote”, “wild card”, etc.

Never encourage dangerous consumption: treat “shots” as “drinks / sips” and keep language light.

Button Mash Brawl (tap-duel)

1v1 mashing race. First to fill bar wins, loser gets consequence.

Flip Clash / Coin Flip King (tool-randomizer)

Coin flip predictions; winner assigns a fun party task.

Stacked Reactions (party-guessing)

Show prompt, everyone secretly chooses an emoji reaction, then reveal / compare.

These should be fun for groups of friends and couples, not strictly romance.

Make sure all “drunk/wasted/party” language is playful and does not promote dangerous behavior.

5️⃣ Engine Routing: Backend + Frontend

Backend (sessions):

When start_game is triggered:

Look up game by id/slug.

Use engineType to:

Create the correct initial state (createLudoState, createPongState, createRacerState, etc.).

Store session.engineType and session.gameSlug.

Route incoming WebSocket actions by session.engineType.

Frontend (Gameplay screen):

Load session.engineType and use a switch to render the right component:

switch (session.engineType) {
  case "prompt-party":
  case "prompt-couple":
    return <PromptGameScreen ... />;
  case "board-ludo":
    return <VelvetLudoScreen ... />;
  case "memory-match":
    return <MemoryFlipScreen ... />;
  case "pong":
    return <EmotionPongScreen ... />;
  case "racer":
    return <NeonDriftScreen ... />;
  case "tap-duel":
    return <DuelArenaScreen ... />;
  case "guessing":
    return <GuessingGameScreen ... />;
  case "rhythm":
    return <RhythmSyncScreen ... />;
  case "roulette":
  case "tool-randomizer":
    return <RouletteToolScreen ... />;
  default:
    return <UnknownGameFallback ... />;
}


PromptGameScreen should be used ONLY for prompt-party / prompt-couple engines, never for pong/racer/etc.

6️⃣ Distinguish Game Types in the UI

Update the catalog UI:

Show clear badges:

“CARD GAME”, “BOARD GAME”, “ARCADE”, “RACE”, “MEMORY”, etc.

“PARTY”, “COUPLE”, “BOTH”

“LOCAL”, “ONLINE”

Filter options:

“Party (friends)”

“Couples”

“Arcade/Skill”

“Card Games”

This makes it obvious that different games are genuinely different.

7️⃣ Testing: Make Sure No Arcade Game Shows Dare Cards as Main UI

Before you’re done, test:

Start Truth or Dare (prompt-party) → should show card prompts.

Start Never Have I Ever → still card-based but with NHIE flavour.

Start Velvet Ludo → MUST show Ludo board, not cards.

Start Velvet Memory Flip → MUST show grid for matching.

Start Emotion Ping-Pong → MUST show pong paddles + ball.

Start Neon Drift—Couple Mode → MUST show racing UI.

Start Couples Duel Arena → MUST show duel UI (buttons, bars), not cards.

Any new party minigames: verify interactive behaviour, scoring, and clear win/end conditions.

In none of these arcade/board/puzzle games should the main screen be “Truth/Dare/Confession/Vote”.

Also ensure:

WebSockets stay connected

Local + online modes both work (online with shared state)

No red errors in browser console

8️⃣ Final Clean-up

Remove/hide games from the catalog that are incomplete or still secretly using the prompt engine as their main logic.

Only keep tiles for games that are fully playable.

Summarize in your response:

Which games are now prompt-based

Which are arcade/board/puzzle

Which new party games were added

Files changed and where engine routing lives
